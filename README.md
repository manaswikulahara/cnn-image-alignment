# 🧠 CNN-Based Image Alignment

This repository contains the code and dataset used for deep learning-based **image alignment** using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The project replaces traditional SIFT-RANSAC pipelines with a neural network approach, enabling robust image registration for aerial and remote sensing imagery.
